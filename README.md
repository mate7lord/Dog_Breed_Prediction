# Dog_Breed_Prediction
1. In this project, we will see how to use Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and test a Convolutional Neural Network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image. This is a supervised learning problem, specifically a multiclass classification problem.
2. We started with downloading the dataset creating the model and finding out the predictions using the model. We can optimize different hyper parameters in order to tune this model for a higher accuracy. This model can be used to predict different breeds of dogs which can be further used by different NGO's working on saving animals and for educational purposes also.
